  # Fix RLS Policies for Leads and Messages Tables

  ## Problem
  Agents can currently see ALL leads in the database instead of only their assigned leads.
  The existing RLS policies use `USING (true)` which allows unrestricted access.

  ## Solution
  This migration replaces the overly permissive RLS policies with proper restrictions:

  ### Leads Table Security
  - Agents can only SELECT their own assigned leads (where agent_id = their user id)
  - Agents can only UPDATE leads assigned to them (status and notes only)
  - Only system/admin can INSERT and DELETE leads

  ### Messages Table Security
  - Users can only SELECT messages where they are sender or recipient
  - Users can only INSERT messages where they are the sender
  - Users can only UPDATE messages where they are the recipient (for marking as read)
  - Users cannot DELETE messages

  ## Important Notes
  1. This will DROP the existing permissive policies
  2. After running this, agents will only see their assigned leads
  3. Admins using username='admin' will have full access via application logic
